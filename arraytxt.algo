Iterate over the array starting from the second element (index 1), because a single element is trivially "sorted."

For each element arr[i], insert it into the sorted portion of the array (i.e., the portion from arr[0] to arr[i-1]).

To do this, compare arr[i] to the elements in the sorted portion and shift them one position to the right until you find the correct position for arr[i].

Once the correct position is found, place arr[i] there.
